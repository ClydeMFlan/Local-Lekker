# Paystack Subscription Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment (Development/Testing)

### Code Review
- [x] `PaystackService.initializeSubscription()` uses plan codes from environment
- [x] Added `_getPlanCode()` helper method
- [x] Added `checkSubscriptionStatus()` method
- [x] Added `cancelSubscription()` method  
- [x] Added `reactivateSubscription()` method
- [x] Webhook handler processes `subscription.charge` events
- [x] `.env.template` documented with plan code placeholders

### Database
- [ ] Run `add_paystack_subscription_code.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Verify column exists: `SELECT paystack_subscription_code FROM subscriptions LIMIT 1;`
- [ ] Check index created: `\di idx_subscriptions_paystack_code` (if using psql)

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Add `PAYSTACK_MONTHLY_PLAN_CODE=PLN_xxxxx` to `.env`
- [ ] Verify `.env` loaded in app (check logs on startup)
- [ ] Restart Flutter app to load new environment variable

### Paystack Dashboard Setup (Test Mode First)
- [ ] Create test plan with monthly interval
- [ ] Copy test plan code
- [ ] Test payment flow with test card `5060666666666666666`
- [ ] Verify subscription created in Paystack dashboard
- [ ] Check `paystack_subscription_code` saved in database

### Webhook Setup (Test Mode)
- [ ] Deploy edge function: `supabase functions deploy paystack-webhook --no-verify-jwt`
- [ ] Copy webhook URL from deployment output
- [ ] Add webhook in Paystack Test Mode dashboard
- [ ] Enable events: `subscription.create`, `subscription.charge`, `subscription.disable`
- [ ] Test webhook delivery: Send test event from dashboard
- [ ] Check logs: `supabase functions logs paystack-webhook --tail`
- [ ] Verify webhook processed successfully (no errors in logs)

### Integration Testing (Test Mode)
- [ ] New member signup → payment → subscription created
- [ ] Check Paystack dashboard: subscription status = "active"
- [ ] Check database: `paystack_subscription_code` populated
- [ ] Check database: `expires_at` set to 30 days from now
- [ ] Simulate renewal: Use 1-minute test plan, wait, check webhook fired
- [ ] Verify `expires_at` extended by interval period
- [ ] Check notification created for user
- [ ] Test subscription cancellation flow (if UI exists)

- [ ] Add `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` to Supabase edge function secrets:
  ```bash
  supabase secrets set PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx
  ```
- [ ] Redeploy edge function: `supabase functions deploy paystack-webhook --no-verify-jwt`

### Production Testing (Real Money - Use Small Amount or Refund)

- [ ] **Optional**: Refund test payment if needed

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up Supabase monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Configure alerts for edge function errors
- [ ] Set up daily cron job to check for orphaned subscriptions:
  ```sql
  -- Subscriptions expired but still active in Paystack
  SELECT * FROM subscriptions 
  WHERE expires_at < NOW() 
  AND paystack_subscription_code IS NOT NULL;
  ```
- [ ] Monitor Paystack webhook delivery success rate
- [ ] Set up email alerts for failed webhook deliveries

### User Communication

## Post-Deployment Monitoring (First 7 Days)

### Daily Checks
- [ ] **Day 1**: Check new subscriptions created successfully
- [ ] **Day 1**: Verify webhook delivery rate > 99%
- [ ] **Day 1**: Check edge function error rate < 0.1%
- [ ] **Day 2-7**: Monitor daily signup conversion rate
- [ ] **Day 2-7**: Check for failed payment notifications
- [ ] **Day 2-7**: Verify `expires_at` dates are correct

### Weekly Checks (First Month)
- [ ] **Week 1**: Review all subscription creation logs
- [ ] **Week 2**: Check for any orphaned subscriptions
- [ ] **Week 3**: Verify webhook signature validation working
- [ ] **Week 4**: Monitor first batch of renewals (30 days after launch)
- [ ] **Week 4**: Check renewal success rate
- [ ] **Week 4**: Verify notifications sent for renewals

### First Renewal Monitoring (Day 30-35)
- [ ] Monitor `subscription.charge` webhook events

## Rollback Plan (If Issues Occur)

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Rollback
- Webhook failing for >50% of events
- Database updates causing data corruption
- Users charged but not receiving access

### Rollback Steps
1. **Disable webhook in Paystack dashboard** (stops new events)
2. **Revert PaystackService code** to use one-time payments:
   ```dart
   // Comment out plan code usage
   // 'plan': planCode,
   ```
3. **Manually process affected subscriptions** via SQL
4. **Issue refunds if necessary** via Paystack dashboard
5. **Communicate with affected users**

### Rollback Validation
- [ ] Verify one-time payments still working
- [ ] Check existing subscriptions not affected
- [ ] Confirm no duplicate charges occurred
- [ ] Review all support tickets related to payments
