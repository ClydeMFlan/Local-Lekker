-- Create a SECURITY DEFINER helper that returns the current caller's role.
-- This function is intended to be called via RPC from the client when RLS
-- prevents direct SELECTs on membership/profile rows. The function runs as
-- the function owner (security definer) so it must be owned by a DB role that
-- has permission to read the underlying tables (typically the DB admin role
-- used for migrations).
